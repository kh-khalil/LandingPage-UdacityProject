# Landing Page Project
This is the 1st project in professional track web development course offered by Udacity and FWD
The object here is to create a simple landing page with dynamic navigation bar 

Note: Nav bar should always appear when I am at the top of the page. Will be fixed later on.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
